# My Spotify API Authorization Code Flow
using fetch instead of depreciated request library and stripping out unneccesary code from official example

official example: https://github.com/spotify/web-api-auth-examples

use the commands ```npm install``` then ```node app.js``` to run

( you'll need to use your own spotify app credentials )
